### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/enginabdan/details/certifications/"><b style="color: white;">My_Certificates</b></a>

I specialize in developing robust Flutter-based applications integrated with GPT, Firebase, and Google AdMob for seamless cross-platform deployment on both iOS and Android. Leveraging GPT API keys, I create intelligent and interactive features, ensuring dynamic user engagement. These applications are secured and enhanced using Firebase authentication and storage, delivering scalable, high-performance solutions that adhere to industry standards.

With a rich background in IT, I bring deep expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Deployment, Statistical Modeling, Data Analysis, Data Manipulation, Data Visualization, Predictive Analysis, and Business Intelligence.

My expertise also extends to UI/UX design using Figma and Canva, enabling me to craft visually appealing and user-centric interfaces for Flutter applications. By combining design tools with development skills, I ensure the delivery of intuitive, modern, and responsive app experiences that captivate users and drive engagement.

Proficient in Python, Flutter, Figma, Canva, MS SQL, SQLite, Tableau, AWS, GCP, Firebase, Android, iOS, Google AdMob, HTML, CSS, Linux, Git, GitHub, SDLC, Agile, and Jira, I am well-versed in managing the complete development lifecycle. My technical acumen extends to deploying state-of-the-art mobile applications that combine AI-driven insights, sleek UI/UX designs, and monetization through AdMob integration.

In the domain of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, my toolkit includes libraries and frameworks like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pycaret, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. I am adept at developing and fine-tuning ML algorithms such as Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and PCA, while my Deep Learning expertise spans CNN and RNN architectures.

On the NLP front, I excel in tasks such as Tokenization, Noise Removal, Lemmatization, Stemming, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Glove, and Sentiment Analysis, building intelligent language models tailored to business needs.

As a tech-savvy app developer, I thrive on designing and deploying AI-powered mobile applications. My projects leverage GPT's advanced AI capabilities, streamlined integration with Firebase for authentication and cloud storage, and seamless deployment on both iOS and Android platforms. I also ensure monetization strategies with Google AdMob for added business value.

Confident and innovative, I thrive on generating novel ideas to foster strong client relationships. A motivational leader, I adeptly manage change to deliver value in every endeavor. Possessing excellent communication skills, self-motivation, computational thinking, and a proactive problem-solving approach, I am a dedicated team player with strong mathematical skills and the ability to quickly grasp and implement new technologies.
